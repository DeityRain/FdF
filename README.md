FdF

ABOUT

FdF (Fil de Fer, “wireframe” in French) is a 42 School project that renders 3D landscapes in isometric projection from a heightmap file.
Built in C with MiniLibX, it’s a mix of graphics, math, and event handling — turning raw data into interactive wireframe art.

INSTALLATION

The program can be build with: make

TO LAUNCH

./fdf ./test_maps/(any map you want).
